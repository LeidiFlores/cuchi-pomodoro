## Best Practices for Contributing

To ensure your contribution is easy to review and integrate:

1. **Small, Focused Pull Requests**: 
   Avoid large PRs that mix many unrelated changes. Instead, make small, focused changes that address a single issue or feature.

2. **Write Clear Commit Messages**: 
   Write meaningful commit messages that explain the intent of your changes. For example:  
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Fix bug in timer reset logic"
   ```

3. **Consistent Code Style**: Follow the project's coding style. Make sure your code is properly formatted by running:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```
4. **Document Your Changes**: If you're adding a new feature, provide documentation (e.g., in the README) that explains how to use it.

5. **Be Descriptive in PRs**: Clearly describe what your pull request does and why. If it fixes an issue, reference it using the issue number (e.g., "Fixes #12").

6. **Stay Up to Date**: Before working on a new feature, pull the latest changes from the main branch to avoid conflicts.

   git add .
   git commit -m "Add [feature/bug] description"
   ```
